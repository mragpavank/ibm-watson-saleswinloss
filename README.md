The data set
For this tutorial, we will use the Sales-Win-Loss data set available on the IBM Watson website. This data set contains the sales campaign data of an automotive parts wholesale supplier.
We will use scikit-learn to build a predictive model to tell us which sales campaign will result in a loss and which will result in a win.
